#Academic Ceritificate on the blockchain

The academic certificate platform using blockchain technology is used to issue, view and manage academic certificates in a secure and distributed manner. This project addresses the need for a secure digital platform to issue and verify academic certificates without intervention from the original certificate issuer (University).

There are three stakeholders(university, student and organization) and their various roles are as follows:

###The university (Admin)

**Create users(students)
**issue academic certificates
**view issued academic certificates

###Student
**Receive academic certificates from university.
**View and manage received academic certificates.
**Share academic certificates with third party(employer).
**accept request to employer to view certificate


###Organization
